Chernobyl: Escape the Fate is a dungeon crawler you haven't seen before. Instead of featuring lots of enemies controlled by AI, you only have one enemy - yourself. Escape the collapsing power plant you thought would be your fate and defeat strange yet complicated security protocols in this entertaining dungeon crawler - puzzle game hybrid.


---Features:
	Randomly-generated map: every level is unique, including items' positions!
	
	Storyline that leaves more questions than answers! Were you to just die in the collapsing building? If so, what's fate, a good or a bad thing?
	
	ASCII art! Been missing those monochrome pictures of symbols? Only the highest-quality images supporting the storyline as you progress.
	
	
---SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
	Python 3.5 or newer - required (Python 3.8 - recommended)
		Built-in modules: random, time - required
		Third-party modules: tcod 11.5.1 or newer - required (via pip - recommended: https://pypi.org/project/tcod/)
	
	IDE - IDLE or PyCharm - strongly recommended
